This program is an E-Commerce System designed for managing various types of products with features like expiry handling and shipping logistics. 
It allows defining products such as cheese, biscuits, TVs, and mobile scratch cards—each with a name, price, and quantity. Some products can expire (like cheese and biscuits),
while others do not (like TVs and scratch cards). Additionally, some products require shipping and provide weight information, while others do not. 
Customers can add items to a shopping cart in specific quantities and proceed to checkout. During checkout, the system verifies product availability, 
checks for expired or out-of-stock items, and ensures the customer has sufficient balance. It calculates the subtotal, shipping fees if applicable, and the total paid amount, 
then updates the customer's balance and product quantities. Shippable items are collected and sent to a shipping service that prints a shipment notice including each item and total package weight. 
The system prints clear, formatted output to the console for all major actions, and is built using interfaces and object-oriented design, making it flexible and easy to extend.
